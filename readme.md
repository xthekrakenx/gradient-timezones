## About Gradient Timezones

This tool shows a variety of timezones in various gradients. This tool was inspired by the Chrome plugin: [Figure it Out](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/figure-it-out/lialghmkggocekkpjbnoacohodmckfke?hl=en-US). It makes a great local home page and is written in HTML/JavaScript using css/bootstrap for stylizing.


## Why This Tool Exists

I deal with a variety of customers in different time zones. One of my best friends uses [Figure it Out](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/figure-it-out/lialghmkggocekkpjbnoacohodmckfke?hl=en-US) - which to me is an amazingly beautiful and simple tool. My work computer is locked down pretty tight - limiting my ability to install any new software or use technology that requires dependencies not already installed so I had to devise a way to emulate the functionality without the need for any sort of local installation.
